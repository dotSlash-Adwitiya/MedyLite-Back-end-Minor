# MedyLite-Back-end-Minor
MedyLite in an android application, made for local chemists to display all the medicines available in their stalk.

This is the back-end written using spring boot & hibernate. I've built REST API's to interact with the DB thereby providing various functionalities such as Registering a new user or chemist, reading the data stored in DB , deleteing updating using PUT,PATCH and delete Request Mappings.
